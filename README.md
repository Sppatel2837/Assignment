Part A – Gene Expression and Tree Growth Analysis
This part of the assignment focused on analyzing gene expression data and tree growth measurements using R. A gene expression dataset was imported, and the mean expression value for each gene was calculated across multiple samples. The analysis identified the top 10 highly expressed genes, with mitochondrial genes such as MT-CO1, MT-ND4, and MT-CO3 showing the highest expression levels. Additionally, it was found that 35,988 genes had mean expression levels below 10, indicating that most genes were expressed at low levels. A histogram was generated to visualize the distribution of mean gene expression values. In the second part of this section, tree growth data collected between 2005 and 2020 from two different sites (northeast and southwest) were examined.Mean and standard deviation of tree circumferences were calculated for both time points, revealing significant growth over the 15-year period. Boxplots were used to compare growth distributions, and the mean 10-year growth was determined to be 42.94 cm for the northeast site and 35.49 cm for the southwest site. A Welch two-sample t-test showed no statistically significant difference in growth between the two sites (p = 0.062), although trees in the northeast exhibited a slightly higher growth trend.

Part B – Comparative Genomics of E. coli and S. aureus
This section involved a comparative genomics analysis of two bacterial species, Escherichia coli MG1655 and Staphylococcus aureus MRSA107, using coding DNA sequences (CDS) data from the Ensembl Bacteria database. The results showed that E. coli contained 4,239 CDS compared to 2,942 in S. aureus, reflecting the larger genome and higher gene content of E. coli. Total coding DNA length was approximately 3.98 Mbp for E. coli and 2.60 Mbp for S. aureus, with E. coli genes also being longer on average. Nucleotide and amino acid frequency analyses revealed clear genomic differences: S. aureus exhibited an A/T-rich genome, whereas E. coli showed higher C/G content. Codon usage analysis confirmed these differences, with S. aureus preferring A/T-ending codons and E. coli favoring G/C-ending codons. Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) plots illustrated these biases. Protein k-mer analysis (k = 3–5) highlighted overrepresented motifs, such as leucine-rich and serine-rich sequences in S. aureus, suggesting variations in protein structure and function. Together, the results demonstrate how R can be applied to analyze both transcriptomic data and genomic features, providing valuable insights into gene expression patterns, evolutionary differences, and functional adaptations in microorganisms.
